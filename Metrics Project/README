# Metrics Project

This is my final code for my Honours Econometrics Project, completed with Brandon Dixon. The paper we wrote together is included in this folder.

The original data was taken from the yelp academic dataset, and we did some cleaning with yelp_data_organize.py.

All of the analysis is done in Final_code_Dixon_Liang.R. We create some descriptive plots of the data, do some distribution comparison tests, and run OLS regressions.
